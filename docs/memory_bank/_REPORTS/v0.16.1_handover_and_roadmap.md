# Handover Report v0.16.1

## Executive Summary
This report marks the transition from "Technical MVP" (v0.16.1) to "Pilot-Ready Product". The roadmap has been restructured into 6 discrete execution phases (10-15) to guide the project towards Go-To-Market.

## Current Status (v0.16.1)
- **Deployment**: Stable on Vercel x Supabase.
- **Verification**: Remote smoke tests passing.
- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router.
- **Backend**: Edge Functions + Supabase DB.

## Strategic Shift
We are moving from *infrastructure implementation* to *product hardening and operational scalability*.

### New Key Objectives
1.  **Metric of Success**: "User Flow Robustness" (Demoing without fear).
2.  **Operational Model**: Admin Console for content management (No more manual DB seeding).
3.  **Expansion**: Support for multiple exams and institutional features.

## Immediate Next Steps (Phase 10)
- **Priority 1**: Back Office Skeleton (RBAC + Admin UI).
- **Priority 2**: UX Polish (Error handling, standardized 401).
- **Priority 3**: Roadmap Visualization (Completed).

## Reference
See [Product Roadmap](../PRODUCT/roadmap.md) for the detailed phase breakdown.
