# Remote Smoke Test Results (v0.13.3)

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Target**: `http://localhost:3000` (Local Proxy to Remote DB)
**Status**: FAILED

## Execution Log
- **Seed**: ✅ Success (Remote DB updated)
- **Functions**: ❌ Connection Refused (Localhost Unreachable)
- **Start/Submit/Plan**: ❌ Failed

## Diagnosis
The local Next.js server (`npm run dev`) was unreachable at `localhost:3000`. 
Since the test relies on the local API routes to proxy requests to the Remote Supabase, the test could not complete.

## Critical Requirement
Tests cannot pass until:
1. Local server is running (`npm run dev`).
2. Remote Edge Functions have Environment Variables set (see Close Report).

## Verdict
**READY FOR PILOT**: NO (Pending Verification)
